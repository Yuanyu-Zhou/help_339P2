        <h2>Lee Haber</h2>
        <p>While attending a Mandarin lesson at a traditional language school, Lee realized that he wasn't really learning anything or getting better at Mandarin. He also realized that studying on his own only got him so far, that the only way he would become fluent was through practice. He started thinking that there must be a better way to learn a new language. Lee brings with him experience in small business and startups. Lee loves learning languages and has proficiency in Spanish, German, Portuguese and Mandarin.</p>
